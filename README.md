# Personal Development Sandbox

This installs an IDE and tools, organized so that it won't collide with anything else on the system.

It is intended for

- local and server operation, based on [Mamba][mamba] and [NeoVim][neovim].
- python, js, lua, shell development and markdown documentation (but extendable to more)

It does not require elevated perms to install.

Customization of NeoVim is based on a distri, currently [AstroNVim][astronvim]

## Bootstrap Installation

This is a run on a minimal debian server:

ðŸ’¡ The installation look and feel may be further improved in the future but you get the idea...


[Here](./setup/astro/README.md) is what you get, currently.
