This installs an IDE and tools, organized so that it won't collide with anything else on the system.


It is intended for

- local and server operation, based on [Mamba][mamba] and [NeoVim][neovim].
- Neovim is your IDE
- Mamba is the package manager for underlying tools the IDE is based upon, incl. a compiler
- python, javascript, lua, shell, markdown lsp support ootb - but extendable

It does not require elevated perms to install.

Customization of NeoVim is based on the **[AstroNVim][astronvim]** distribution.

## Bootstrap Installation

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AXGKl/pds/master/setup/pds.sh
chmod +x pds.sh
./pds.sh i[nstall]
```

Requirements: bash, wget.

OS: Currently only tested on Linux.

üí° OSX and BSDs *should* work as well. We do use the Linux style configuration directories though.


This is a run on a minimal debian server:

üí° The installation look and feel may be further improved in the future but you get the idea...

### Existing NeoVim Install

Before installing pds, you might want to run `pds.sh stash mybackup`.

This moves `~/.config/nvim`, `~/.local/state/nvim`, `~/.local/share/nvim` to an archive, ready for
later restoration via `pds restore mybackup`.

`pds clean-all` would erase the existing install.

## Features

- [Here](./setup/astro/README.md) is what you get, config wise, currently.
- pds offers to assert on your config working via tests, see the 'tmux' tests.



## Usage

vi (opening neovim) is installed callable from the app image into `~/pds/bin/vi`.

At pds install time, we've set a function to your `.bashrc` (and `.zshrc`, if in use):

    function pds { source "/home/gk/.config/pds/setup/pds.sh" "$@"; }

This allows to call neovim in 3 different ways:

- `$HOME/bin/vi`: runs neovim - but additional mamba tools are not in your $PATH
- `pds <tool, e.g. vi>`: calls `( insert ~/pds/bin to $PATH && <tool> )`, i.e. you have
  the PATH set, while executing vi.
- `pds a[ctivate]` and subsequently `vi`: First adds the path permanently, then will find
  `vi` (or other tools later)

We recommend the last way, calling `pds a` e.g. in `.profile`:

When activating virtual environments after `pds a`, you'll have their tools (e.g. python)
AND the ones from pds - in the right search order - available in your editor.



## Further Personalization

TBD


## Writing Tests

See the `*-tmux-*` tests for some blueprints.

### Gotchas

- Mind Test Screen Size

‚ö†Ô∏è Do not assert on content shown only at wider screensizes! Try your tests with the same
tmux geometry than in `pds.sh`'s `run_tmux` function (40x100 by default).

- Popups may not always show

See the LSP Diagnostics user test. Since we got intermittend failures, where in deed the
diagnostics popup did not show up, we let first attempt die within a subshell, then retry once like this:

```
# type j k, then the popup *must* show up:
(‚úîÔ∏è max 1000 diag) || { ‚å®Ô∏è j k; ‚úîÔ∏è max 1000 diag; }
```
